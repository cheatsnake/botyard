# Contribution

Botyard is a open source, so anyone can contribute to the development of the project.

If you have any suggestions, or you have found some kind of bugs, feel free to create an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/cheatsnake/botyard/issues). If you have specific suggestions for making changes to the source code, you can create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/cheatsnake/botyard/pulls).

Do you want to help, but you don't know how? We still have a really huge amount of work ahead of us, for example:

-   Writing guides for various programming languages.
-   Implementing multilingual support.
-   Creating native clients for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux.
-   Developing SDK libraries for convenient work with the platform API.
-   Interesting examples of bots for our demo showcase.
-   Connectors for file storages like Google Drive, AWS S3, Azure Storage, etc.
-   Expanding the functionality of the platform (advanced authorization, message streaming, integration with other systems, etc.)
-   Code refactoring, various optimizations and fixes.

And a bunch of other things :D
